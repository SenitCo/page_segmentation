% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code

% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}

% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

Most page segmentation algorithms are geared toward full page analysis.
However, in resource constrained environments, a full page is not available. In
a consumer product such as a dedicated desktop scanner or MFP (Multi-Function
Printer), typical memory resources are very small
Storing a full page would require a cost prohibitive amount of
memory. 

We study two page segmentation algorithms (Voronoi, RAST) to discover
how each algorithm behaves against a smaller image subset. The OCRopus page
segmentation toolkit is used as the basis of this work. 

The tests are run against a set of scanned document images with know ground
truth text/non-text zones.  The input images are divided into strips. The full
page segmentation performance of OCRopus is measured. The results are then
compared against the OCRopus performance with each set of smaller strips. 

Our evaluation shows RAST is the best performer in an image strip page
segmentation. While performance is degraded over a full page analysis, the
results are encouraging enough to study modifications to RAST to improve its
performance in an image strip page segmentation.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart

Page segmentation is the process of dividing a scanned document image into
zones of different content such as text paragraph, business graphic, halftoned
image, etcetera. Different image zones can be optimized differently depending
on their content. This paper focuses only on text and non-text zones. 

Even in a resource-constrained environment, image quality is still a
requirement. Being able to differentiate a text region from a graphics region
will allow the firmware/hardware to optimize the output. A text region should
use a heavy contrast (clip to black/white) and sharpen. A graphics region
should preserve as much dynamic range as possible. A smooth or even a halftone
descreen could also be performed on a graphics region.

In a consumer level scanner or MFP (Multi-Function printer—a scanner+printer
combination) a full image, even at low resolution, exceeds available
memory. In the consumer marker, a scanner/MFP is a commodity and, as such, cost
is the driving factor. A very small amount of memory is available for use
during a scan/copy. A full 300 dpi monochrome image is 8M. A color scan/copy is
25M. At higher qualities, a 600 dpi scan would be over 100M. A typical consumer
MFP has between 8M and 128M. 

Most page segmentation algorithmns are tested against a full-page image. The
published algorithms on the topic were all tested and studied against a full-page
image.

This paper explores the behavior of two page segmentation algorithms on image
strips.  An image strip is a full-page width but smaller height of the original
image. The strip results are compared to the full-page results. The goal of the
experiment is to find a page segmentation algorithm that best scales downward
to image strips. The best algorithm would be the topic of further study toward
tuning the algorithm for page segmentation with image strips.

Exploring how strip based page segmentation would have application not only in
paper scanners but in other areas where a full page image could be too large to
store in available memory. A micro-fiche scanner comes to mind. Further, with
the proliferation of mobile devices (phones, tablets, etcetera), camera-based
imaging has become a topic of interest.  However, mobile devices are memory
constrained in much the same way as desktop scanner/copier products. Rather
than storing an entire image in active memory, small strips could be extracted
and segmented as described in this paper.

\section{Previous Work}

There is a large body of literature on the problem of page segmentation with
several competing algorithms. There is also a body of literature studying the
relative merits of the different algorithms. [Performance Comparison of Six
Algorithms] highlighted six algorithms: XYCUT, SMEARING, VORONOI, WHITESPACE
ANALYSIS, and CONSTRAINED TEXT LINE DETECTION. The [PSET] analyzed XYCUT,
DOCSTRUM, and VORONOI algorithms as well as two commercial systems from
Caere Corporation and ScanSoft Corporation. [Document structure analysis
algorithms] not only cataloged many segmentation algorithms but their
performance as well.

Page segmentation algorithms are usually divided into top-down and bottom-up
categories [Performance Compare][MAO] with some algorithms considered a hybrid
mix of the two. A top-down algorithm examines the entire image, finding
structure in the image, then drilling into deeper detail.  A bottom-up
algorithm examines the image at the pixel level then builds a larger picture of
the document from smaller components. [WHITESPACE ANALYSIS] contains a good
description of top-down vs bottom-up.

X-Y Cut is a top-down algorithm that recursively breaks an image
into rectangular blocks using horizontal and vertical projection histograms.
Rectangles are recursively split based on valleys in the histogram. 

Docstrum is a bottom-up algorithm that uses the distance between clusters of
connected components. The k-nearest-neighbors of the components are measured
and the docstrum is the plot of all nearest neighbor pairs on a page.
[DOCSTRUM]

Smearing is a bottom-up algorithm that transforms the image at the pixel level
by setting 0 pixels to 1 based on their neighbors' values. Black areas are
connected together. The algorithm is run along rows then along columns and the
two images combined.

Whitespace analysis is a top-down algorithm that starts with bounding boxes of
black connected components. Rectangles of whitespace are built around the black
components such that no rectangle intersects with a black component. The
resulting rectangles are repeatedly combined to form a cover. The bounding box
of the uncovered region is treated as a text segment. 

Voronoi as a page segementation algorithm is a bottom-up algorithm. The
segmentation starts with centroids of connected components. A point voronoi
diagram is built around those points. Extraneous edges are filtered out leaving
an area Voronoi diagram of island regions.

Constrained Text Line Detection is a top down algorithm that works by first
finding whitespace rectangles that represent gutters. The gutters become
obstacles in computing the bounding boxes of text lines.

RAST is not part of the [Performance Compare][Mao] papers. Rather, RAST was
included because this paper is heavily based on the work in
\cite{IEEEhowto:Winder} and OCRopus. RAST is a bottom-up algorithm that starts
with bounding boxes of connected components. Statistics on the boxes are used
to decide if the box contains a character. Next, the whitespace cover is
computed, similar to [CONSTRAINED TEXT LINE]. As both RAST and [CONSTRAINED]
are by the same author, RAST builds upon [CONSTRAINED]. The text lines are
found based on contiguous character boxes.

\section{Method}
This study leveraged from working previously performed by Amy Winder
[footnote]. In \cite{IEEEhowto:Winder}, the OCRopus v0.4.3 was extended with
additional page segmentation capabilities. The Voronoi algorithm was extended.
Also, XYCut and RAST were extended to add XML zone output. The XML zone output
allowed measurement of the improvement in page segmentation.

This study uses the XML output from \cite{IEEEhowto:Winder} from the RAST and
Voronoi page segmentation algorithms. Voronoi was judged to be of high quality
in [“six algorithms for page segmentation”]. The RAST algorithm was not part of
the [“six algorithms”] paper. 

The RAST and Voronoi page segmentation programs read a PNG file and output a
segmented PNG image and an XML zone file. The metric comparison is the same as
used in \cite{IEEEhowto:Winder} which is the same as used in [pset]. The metric comparison
reads a ground truth XML zone file and an output XML file. A metric [0,1.0] is
output where 0 is no match and 1.0 is full match. 

The ground truth pages used in this study are from the UW-III “LINEWORD” set of
1600 pages. Also used were the ground truth images used in \cite{IEEEhowto:Winder}. The
\cite{IEEEhowto:Winder} images are simple high quality scanned pages consisting of one or two
columns of text, some pages interspersed with images. All images tested were
300 dpi.  The pages were divided into strips of 1”, 2” (300 rows and 600 rows),
a small enough amount to fit within the constrained memory. 

%\begin{tabular}
%\begin{tabular}{|r|l|}
%\hline
%    1 inch  & 300 rows  & 780kB mono  & 2,34MB RGB color \\
%    2 inches  & 600 rows  & 1,56MB mono  & 4,68MB RGB color \\
%    11 inches & 3300 rows & 8,5M mono & 25,2MB RGB color \\
%%    1 inch  & 300 rows  & 780kB mono  & 2.34MB RGB color \\

%%    11 inches & 3300 rows & 8.5M mono & 25.2MB RGB color \\
%\hline
%\label{table:image-size}
%\end{tabular}

A window was slid down the page image, 10 rows at a time, generating the 300
row strips. A window size of 20 rows was used for the 600 row strips.  The
sliding window simulated the scanned image in memory. As new rows arrive, the
oldest rows are ejected. Only a fixed size strip is in memory at a time. Each
LINEWORD image was split into 330 PNG files of 300 rows each and 165 PNG files
of 600 rows each.  Given the 1600 UW-III LINEWORD images, there were over
520,000 files computed for the 300 row strips and 260,000 files for the 600 row
strips.

The UW-III images contain ZONEBOX “.box” files indicating ground truth text
areas of the images. In order to compare the strip images against a known
ground truth, the ZONEBOX files were also divided into strips. A Python script
parsed the .box files into a set of four point rectangles. A full page width
strip rectangle of 300 or 600 rows was then intersected against all the
zoneboxes. The intersection of the two rectangles became new ground truth
zoneboxes. The page width strip was repeatedly slid 10 rows down then the
intersection was tested again. The final output of each “slide” is a .XML file
indicating the zoneboxes in each window.

The RAST and Voronoi page segmentation programs were run against the new strip
image. The output XML was saved to a separate file. The zone comparison program
was run against the sliced ground truth file and the experimental results. The
RAST and Voronoi page segmentation programs were also run against the full page
to create a baseline of behavior of the two algorithms.

%While the algorithms used in this paper were RAST and Voronoi, the code that
%did the actual page segmentation was two separate executables, both based on on
%OCRopus 4.3.2. The two programs instantiated an instance of the OCRopus
%segmentation class, SegmentPageByRAST() and SegmentPageByVoronoi(),
%respectively.

\section{Performance Metrics}
``To quantitatively evaluate algorithms, a meaningful and computable metric is
essential.'' [Empirical Performance Evaluations of Page Segmentation Algorithms]
The most referenced paper studying multiple page segmentation is [Performance
Comparison of Six Algorithms] which used the performance metric as defined in
[Empirical Performance Evaluation of Page Segmentation Algorithms]. The metric
is based on bounding boxes of text lines. Various measurements such as
horizontally/vertically merged lines, false detections, etc. are combined to
form a Text-line Accuracy.

The metric chosen in this paper is based on finding only text/non-text zones.
The UW-III ZONEBOX files were particularly well adapted to this simple
metric. The \cite{IEEEhowto:Winder} test image set was divided into bounding boxes for text
and non-text zones. 

The metric itself was calculated using the zone comparison program written as
part of \cite{IEEEhowto:Winder}. The zone comparison program is based on the
metric chosen for the ICDAR 2007 Handwriting Segmentation Contest and is
described in \cite{IEEEhowto:Gatos} and originally formulated in
\cite{IEEEhowto:Philips}. 

The text area matching algorithm of \cite{IEEEhowto:Philips} calculates a
text area matching score by first calculating the intersection of the ground
truth bounding box and the result bounding box. The intersection is
then divided by the larger of the two areas. A set of metrics on how well the
zones were discovered are next calculated.  The one-to-many and many-to-one
matches are calculated both from the perspective of the ground truth and the
detected areas. 

For example, a single ground truth bounding box could have been split into
multiple boxes in the result. That would be a one-to-many error. Multiple
ground truth boxes combined into a single box would be a many-to-one error.

The weights used in the zone comparison program are shown in Table
\ref{table:table-weights}. The
correct one-to-one matches are weighted more heavily than the one-to-many and
the many-to-one matches. The good matches are weighed more heavily than the
wrong matches.

\section{Results}

All images from both the Winder and the UW-III datasets with 
the 300, 600 row strips, and the fullpage were run with both the RAST and
Voronoi algorithms. Comparing the results of stripsize vs algorithm per dataset
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:all-qualitative}. The Winder data set is much
cleaner than the UW-III dataset so the better results for Winder are no
surprise. The goal of this research is to find the algorithm that compares best
to segmenting a full page image when the image is shrunk to a small strip. The
RAST algorithm appears to perform much better than Voronoi on both data sets.
RAST on a 300 row vs a 600 row strip in the Winder dataset is little changed.
300 and 600 performed almost identically but not as well as a full page. There
was very little additional improvement in going from a 300 row strip to a 600
row strip which would indicate the smaller strip size (and corresponding lower
memmory requirements) work well.

\end{figure}

The UW-III results are more puzzling. The degradation of results from the
strip images to the full page is understandable given the extra challenges in
the UW-III dataset images. When the image was broken up into horizontal strips,
we avoided some of the page scanning artifacts. The UW-III Voronoi results are
show an increase in performance from 300 to 600 then a sharp drop. That result
needs further exploration.

Overall, the results are encouraging. The segmentation algorithms performed
better on the image strips than the full page. There were several 1.0 (perfect
match) image strip results. A perfect match would usually occur with
pages with little page edge noise and clearly aligned blocks of text. Because
the 300 and 600 behaved so closely, all the following results only examine the
300 stripsize.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:winder-class-rast-vs-vor} shows all results of the Winder
tests. Figure~\ref{fig:uwiii-class-rast-vs-vor} shows all results of the
UW-III tests. Shown are the fullpage RAST and Voronoi alongside the results
for stripsize 300. In the Winder results the fullpage RAST performs the best in
all cases except Magazine (M). The encouraging result is the RAST 300 is in
close second to the fullpage on several classes. The Multi-Column layout (MC)
result is almost identical. Given the restricted size of the segmentation area,
the Rast 300 is performing quite well. The UW-III results paint a slightly
different view. On several of the classes, the Voronoi performs better than the
RAST. However, the Rast 300 performs as good as or better than all other
contenders in ten of the twelve tests!

\subsection{Zeros}

The metric used to calculate strip match quality would yield a 1.0 on a perfect
match--the ground truth and the result segmentation matched. However, there
were several reasons a zero metric would arise. A zero could result from an
empty strip--there is nothing to match and the ground truth also would be
empty. The resulting equation would be 0/0 giving NAN. Because the original
metric was not designed to handle empty images (why would the test set contain
an empty page?), the metric would give a zero on both an empty image/ground
truth and a miss (no matching zones). Future work would include matching empty
ground truth with an empty segmented strip.

\subsection{Winder Data Results}

The first results are against the \cite{IEEEhowto:Winder} data set. The
\cite{IEEEhowto:Winder} data set is a relatively clean set of images without a
lot of challenging artifacts found in the UW-III images.

The overall performance of RAST and Voronoi is shown in the histograms in
Figure~\ref{fig:winder-fullpage-rast} and \ref{fig:winder-fullpage-vor}. The figures
show the performance of RAST and Voronoi on the full pages in the Winder
data set. The RAST results are slightly better than the Voronoi. The Winder
data set pages are well formed along Manhattan layout. The RAST algorithm
excels at primarily vertical/horizontal layouts which might explain the better
RAST results.

Directly comparing RAST vs Voronoi on the winder data set is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:winder-class-rast-vs-vor}. In this chart, the average
performance of each class in the winder data set over both RAST and Voronoi.
RAST has the advantage in all cases except the Magazine. The Magazine images
contain text flowing around images. Voronoi would be better at handling the
freer flowing format than the block-oriented RAST.

\end{figure}

Given the full page results, we examine the results of the 300 row sliding
window. The Voronoi segmentation is run on each of the 330 sub-images in each of
the 459 Winder images. A histogram of the metrics is displayed in
\ref{fig:300-winder-vor}. There are a conspicuous number of zero results. 

The RAST segmentation has slightly better results as shown in
\ref{fig:300-winder-rast}. There is a large peak at the 1.0 (perfect match) and
several good peaks at ~0.70 and ~0.65. The RAST algorithm seems to perform
better than Voronoi on the Winder data set strip images.

while the mean of the sliding winding was 0.59. There were several results at
or above the 0.78 metric. Again, several zeros were also found. The metric drop
from .78 to .59 could be attribed to the zeros at the bottom third (a strong
graphics location) and the bottom of the page (whitespace).

\subsection{UW-III Data Results}

The \cite{IEEEhowto:Winder} data set is a relatively clean set of images. The results for
those images is quite good. The UW-III data set is a much more challenging set
of images. Many of the images contain strong vertical black lines that result
from scanning a book (the edges of the pages are caught as shadows). 

Figure~\ref{fig:uwiii-fullpage-rast-nonzero} is a histogram showing the RAST fullpage results of
all 1600 UW-III images.  Figure~\ref{fig:uwiii-fullpage-vor-nonzero} shows the Voronoi
fullpage results. Note there were several zero results not shown. Many of the
UW-III images had strong black vertical artifacts indicative of book scanning
Voronoi seems to have the edge in the fullpage analysis likely due to the
images' scanning artifacts.  (page edges). Neither RAST nor Voronoi page
segmentation programs attempted to compensate for such artifacts. Filtering out
the failures in further future work will require better preprocessing on those
images to compensate for such artifacts. Note RAST seems to perform better
overall than Voronoi.

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we studied the relative performance of the RAST and VOronoi page
segmentation algorithms when the images were constrained to 300 or 600 row
strips. The tests were run against the UW-III LINEWORD images and an additional
image test set from \cite{IEEEhowto:Winder}. The fullpage images were divided
into smaller images using a sliding window to partially mimic a desktop
scanner.

THe RAST results were almost uniformly better than the Voronoi. THe RAST 600
stripsize had little improvement over the 300 stripsize even in the cases where
the full image performed much better than the strip. The one exception was the
highly mixed layout from the Magazine images in \cite{IEEEhowto:Winder}.

Overall, RAST with a 300 stripsize performed well enough that the algorithm is
a good candidate for for study. The eventual goal would be to implement RAST in
a hardware circuit (ASIC) for real-time performance in an MFP.

Neither RAST nor Voronoi program performed any preprocessing on the incoming
image other than binarization. The input to the segmentation is the source
image. There is no attempt to deskew or eliminate page margin issues. The more
favorable results with the Winder dataset (compared to the UW-III dataset) is
because the Winder dataset is relatively clean. The UW-III dataset has many
artifacts that would be unlikely in a modern desktop scanner, especially the
large black areas caused by catching multiple page edges in a book scan. Most
modern desktop scanners use a CIS (Compact Image Sensor) which has a very short
depth of field. Older scanners used a folded optics array (several mirrors
which shrank and redirected the image onto a single small sensor). The
folded optics array scanners have a very high depth of field and will thus
capture more extraneous information.

Future work would focus on preprocessing and image clean-up suitable for a
strip. The heavy black areas (book page edges) so indicative of the UW-III
dataset would be targeted by left/right margin clean-up using connected
components. The connected components larger than a specific size and that
stretched top to bottom of the strip could be ignored.
