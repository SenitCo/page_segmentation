% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

Most page segmentation algorithms are geared toward full page analysis.
However, in resource constrained environments, a full page is not available. In
a consumer product such as a dedicated desktop scanner or MFP (Multi-Function
Printer), typical memory resources are much smaller than a modern
desktop PC. Storing a full page would require a cost prohibitive amount of
memory. The image processing benefits of page segmentation would be
advantageous even in a smaller platform.

We study two page segmentation algorithms (Voronoi, RAST) to discover
how each algorithm behaves against a smaller image subset. The OCRopus page
segmentation toolkit is used as the basis of this work. 

The tests are run against the UW-III LINEWORD set with the ground truth
modified into smaller rectangular strips. The input images are divided into
strips of one inch (300 rows). The full page segmentation performance of
OCRopus is measured. The results are then compared against the OCRopus
performance with each set of smaller strips. 

Our evaluation shows RAST is the best performer in an image strip page
segmentation. While performance is degraded over a full page analysis, the
results are encouraging enough to study modifications to RAST to improve its
performance in an image strip page segmentation.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart

Most page segmentation algorithmns are tested against a full-page image. The
published algorithms on the topic were all tested and studied against a full-page
image.

In a consumer level scanner or MFP (Multi-Function printer—a scanner+printer
combination) a full image, even at low resolution, exceeds available
memory. IN the consumer marker, a scanner/MFP is a commodity and, as such, cost
is the driving factor. A very small amount of memory is available for use
during a scan/copy. A full 300 dpi monochrome image is 8M. A color scan/copy is
25M. At higher qualities, a 600 dpi scan would be over 100M. A typical consumer
MFP would have between 8M and 128M. 

Even in a resource-constrained environment, image quality is still a
requirement. Being able to differentiate a text region from a graphics region
will allow the firmware/hardware to optimize the output. A text region should
use a heavy contrast (clip to black/white) and sharpen. A graphics region
should preserve as much dynamic range as possible. A smooth or even a halftone
descreen could also be performed on a graphics region.

This paper explores the behavior of two page segmentation algorithms on image
strips.  An image strip is a full-page width but smaller height of the original
image. The strip results are compared to the full-page results. The goal of the
experiment is to find a page segmentation algorithm that best scales downward
to image strips. The best algorithm would be the topic of further study toward
tuning the algorithm for image strips.

\section{Previous Work}
There is a large body of literature on the problem of page segmentation with
several competing algorithms. There is also a body of literature studying the
relative merits of the different algorithms. [Performance Comparison of Six
Algorithms] highlighted six algorithms: XYCUT, SMEARING, VORONOI, WHITESPACE
ANALYSIS, and CONSTRAINED TEXT LINE DETECTION. The [PSET] analyzed XYCUT,
DOCSTRUM, and VORONOI algorithms as well as two commercial systems from
Caere Corporation and ScanSoft Corporation. [Document structure analysis
algorithms] not only cataloged many segmentation algorithms but their
performance as well.

\section{Method}
This study leveraged from working previously performed by Amy Winder
[footnote]. In [winder], the ocropus v0.4.3 was extended with additional page
segmentation capabilities. The Voronoi algorithm was extended. Also, XYCut and
RAST were extended to add XML zone output. The XML zone output allowed a
measurement of the improvement in page segmentation.

This study uses the XML output from [winder] from the RAST and Voronoi page
segmentation algorithms. Voronoi was judged to be of high quality in [“six
algorithms for page segmentation”]. The RAST algorithm was not part of the
[“six algorithms”] paper. 

The RAST and Voronoi page segmentation programs read a PNG file and output a
segmented PNG image and an XML zone file. The metric comparison is the same as
used in [winder] which is the same as used in [pset]. The metric comparison
reads a ground truth XML zone file and an output XML file. A metric [0,1.0] is
output where 0 is no match and 1.0 is full match. 

The ground truth pages used in this study is the UW-III “LINEWORD” set of 1600
pages. Also used were the ground truth images used in [winder]. The [winder]
images are simple high quality scanned pages consisting of one or two columns
of text, some pages interspersed with images. All images tested were 300 dpi.
The pages were divided into strips of 1”, 2” or 300 rows and 600 rows, a small
enough amount to fit within the constrained memory. 

Table:
1” 300 rows 780kB mono  2.34MB RGB color
2” 600 rows 1.56MB mono  4.68MB RGB color

Sliding a window down the page image, 10 rows at a time, generated the strips.
The sliding window simulated the scanned image in memory. As new rows arrive,
the oldest rows are ejected. Only a fixed size strip is in memory at a
time. Each LINEWORD image was split into 330 PNG files of 300 rows each.
Given the 1600 UW-III LINEWORD images, there were over 500,000 files
computed.

The UW-III images contain ZONEBOX “.box” files indicating ground truth text
areas of the images. In order to compare the strips images against a known
ground truth, the ZONEBOX files were also divided into strips. A Python script
parsed the .box files into a set of four point rectangles. A full page width
strip rectangle of 300 or 600 rows was then intersected against all the
zoneboxes. The intersection of the two rectangles became new ground truth
zoneboxes. The page width strip was repeatedly slid 10 rows down then the
intersection was tested again. The final output of each “slide” is a .XML file
indicating the zoneboxes in each window.

The RAST and Voronoi page segmentation programs were run against the new strip
image. The output XML was saved to a separate file. The zone comparison program
was run against the sliced ground truth file and the experimental results. The
RAST and Voronoi page segmentation programs were also run against the full page
to create a baseline of behavior of the two algorithms. 

\section{RAST and Voronoi with OCRopus}
While the algorithms used in this paper were RAST and Voronoi, the code that
did the actual page segmentation was two separate executables, both based on on
OCRopus 4.3.2. The two programs instantiated an instance of the OCRopus
segmentation class, SegmentPageByRAST() and SegmentPageByVoronoi(),
respectively. Neither program performs any preprocessing on the incoming image
other than binarization.

\section{Performance Metrics}
``To quantitatively evaluate algorithms, a meaningful and computable metric is
essential.'' [Empirical Performance Evaluations of Page Segmentation Algorithms]
The most referenced paper studying multiple page segmentation is [Performance
Comparison of Six Algorithms] which used the performance metric as defined in
[Empirical Performance Evaluation of Page Segmentation Algorithms]. The metric
is based on bounding boxes of text lines. Various measurements such as
horizontally/vertically merged lines, false detections, etc. are combined to
form a Text-line Accuracy.

The metric chosen in this paper is based on finding only text/non-text zones.
The UW-III ZONEBOX files were particularly well adapted to this simple
metric. The [winder] test image set was divided into bounding boxes for text
and non-text zones. 

The metric itself was calculated using the zone comparison program written as
part of \cite{IEEEhowto:Winder}. The zone comparison program is based on the
metric chosen for the ICDAR 2007 Handwriting Segmentation Contest and is
described in \cite{IEEEhowto:Gatos} and originally formulated in
\cite{IEEEhowto:Philips}. 

The text area matching algorithm of \cite{IEEEhowto:Philips} calculates a
text area matching score by first calculating the intersection of the ground
truth bounding box and the result bounding box. The intersection is
then divided by the larger of the two areas. A set of metrics on how well the
zones were discovered are next calculated.  The one-to-many and many-to-one
matches are calculated both from the perspective of the ground truth and the
detected areas. 

For example, a single ground truth bounding box could have been split into
multiple boxes in the result. That would be a one-to-many error. Multiple
ground truth boxes combined into a single box would be a many-to-one error.

The weights used in the zone comparison program are shown in Table ref. The
correct one-to-one matches are weighted more heavily than the one-to-many and
the many-to-one matches. The good matches are weighed more heavily than the
wrong matches.

\section{Results}
The first results are against the [winder] data set. The [winder] data set is a
relatively clean set of images without a lot of challenging artifacts in the
UW-III images.

The overall performance of RAST and Voronoi is shown in the histograms in
\ref{fig:winder-fullpage-rast} and \ref{fig:winder-fullpage-vor}. The figures
show the performance of the RAST and Voronoi on the full pages in the Winder
data set. The RAST results are slightly better than the Voronoi. The Winder
data set pages are well formed along Manhattan layout. The RAST algorithm
excels at primarily vertical/horizontal layouts which might explain the better
RAST results.

performance of each class in the winder data set over both RAST and Voronoi.
RAST has the advantage in all cases except the Magazine.

Given the full page results, we examine the results of the 300 row sliding
window. The Voronoi segmentation is run on each of the 330 sub-images in each of
the 459 Winder images. A histogram of the metrics is displayed in
\ref{fig:300-winder-vor}. There are a conspicuous number of zero results. 

The RAST segmentation has slightly better results as shown in
\ref{fig:300-winder-rast}. There is a large peak at the 1.0 (perfect match) and
several good peaks at ~0.70 and ~0.65. The RAST algorithm seems to perform
better than Voronoi on the Winder data set strip images.

We now more closely examine the behavior of RAST on the winder 300 strips.
\ref{fig:winder-300-double-2col300} shows a double column, all
text page from \cite{IEEEhowto:Winder} data set. The traversal of the RAST
segmentation down the page is shown in the jagged lines. The mean of the RAST
results down the page is 0.78 while the full page metric is 1.0.  The 0.78
result is quite useful with many 1.0 hits. The zeroes at the bottom of the
image (right side of the graph) are the bottom white space of the page. (No
matches and no ground truth results in a zero.)

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:winder-300-double-pic-2col300} shows a more complicated page of
two columns with included halftoned graphics. The overall RAST metric was 0.78
while the mean of the sliding winding was 0.59. There were several results at
or above the 0.78 metric. Again, several zeros were also found. The metric drop
from .78 to .59 could be attribed to the zeros at the bottom third (a strong
graphics location) and the bottom of the page (whitespace).

The [winder] data set is a relatively clean set of images. The results for
those images is quite good. The UW-III data set is a much more challenging set
of images. Many of the images contain strong vertical black lines that result
from scanning a book (the edges of the pages are caught as shadows). 

Figure N is a histogram showing the RAST results of all 1600 UW-III images.
Note there were several zero results. Many of the UW-III images had strong
black vertical artifacts indicative of book scanning (page edges). Neither the
RAST nor the Voronoi page segmentation programs attempted to compensate for
such artifacts. Filtering out the failures (further future work will require
better preprocessing on those images to compensate for such artifacts).

The results are encouraging. The segmentation algorithms performed better on
the image strips that the full page. There were several 1.0 (perfect match)
image strip results. A perfect match would usually occur with pages with
little page edge noise and clearly aligned blocks of text.

% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
