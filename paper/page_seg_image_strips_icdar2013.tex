% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***

% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.png, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\usepackage{subfigure}
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

%\boldmath
Most page segmentation algorithms are geared toward full page analysis.
However, in resource constrained environments, such as dedicated consumer
desktop scanners or MFPs (Multi-Function Printers), a full page is not
available.  Storing a full page would require a cost prohibitive amount of
memory. 

We study two page segmentation algorithms (Voronoi and RAST) to discover how
each algorithm behaves in the full page environment relative to  a smaller
image subset. The OCRopus page segmentation toolkit is used as the basis of
this work.  The tests are run against two sets of scanned document images with
known ground truth indicating text/non-text zones, the UW-III LINEWORD images
and a BSU dataset.  The input images are divided into strips.  The results of
the performance on the smaller strips is compared to  the full page
segmentation performance. 

Our evaluation shows that RAST performs well in an image strip page
segmentation. The results are encouraging enough to study modifications to RAST
to improve its performance in an image strip page segmentation.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart

High image quality is a trait desired in all document images.
In the printer environment this can be increased by differentiating the processing of text versus image zones.
Being able to differentiate a text region from a graphics region
will allow the firmware/hardware to optimize the output. A text region should
use a heavy contrast (clip to black/white) and sharpen. A graphics region
should preserve as much dynamic range as possible. A smooth or even a halftone
descreen could also be performed on a graphics region.
A page can be divided into
zones of different content such as text paragraph, business graphic, halftoned
image, etc. through page segmentation.

Page segmentation algorithms are usually designed under the assumption that a full page image will be provided.
In the consumer market, a scanner/MFP (Multi-Function Printer=a scanner+printer combination) is a commodity and, as such, cost is the driving factor. 
In a consumer level scanner or MFP a full image, even at low resolution, exceeds available memory. 
A full 300 dpi monochrome image is 8M. A color scan/copy is
25M. At higher qualities, a 600 dpi scan would be over 100M. A typical consumer
MFP has between 8M and 128M. 
Therefore a page segmentation algorithm that performs well on a small portion, or strip, of a page image is needed so these devices can use content based preprocessing.

In addition to MFPs
strip based page segmentation would have application 
in other areas where a full page image could be too large to
store in available memory, such as a micro-fiche scanner. 
With the proliferation of mobile devices (phones, tablets, etc.), camera-based
imaging has become a topic of interest.  However, mobile devices are memory
constrained in much the same way as desktop scanner/copier products. 
Processing on small strips could be performed as described in this paper,
rather than storing an entire image in active memory.

This paper explores the behavior of two page segmentation algorithms on image strips.
An image strip is the full-page width, but a fraction of the height of the original image.
Most page segmentation algorithmns are tested against a full-page image. 
The strip results are compared to the full-page results. The goal of the
experiment is to find a page segmentation algorithm that best scales downward
to image strips. The best algorithm would be the topic of further study toward
tuning the algorithm for page segmentation with image strips.

% ========================================
%  Previous Work
% ========================================

\section{Previous Work}

%There is a large body of literature on the problem of page segmentation with
%several competing algorithms. There is also a body of literature studying the
%relative merits of the different algorithms. [Performance Comparison of Six
%Algorithms] highlighted six algorithms: XYCUT, SMEARING, VORONOI, WHITESPACE
%ANALYSIS, and CONSTRAINED TEXT LINE DETECTION. 

There are many page segmentation algorithms.  Page segmentation algorithms are
usually divided into top-down and bottom-up categories
\cite{shafait2006performance,mao2000empirical} with some algorithms considered
a hybrid mix of the two.
A top-down algorithm examines the entire image, finding
structure in the image, then drilling into deeper detail.  
A bottom-up algorithm examines the image at the pixel level then builds a
larger picture of the document from smaller components.  A good description of
top-down vs. bottom-up segmentation algorithms is
available in \cite{baird1994background}.

Examples of top-down algorithms are 
    X-Y Cut, \cite{nagy1992prototype},
    Whitespace Analysis \cite{baird1994background}, and
    Constrained Text Line Detection \cite{breuel2002two}.
X-Y Cut recursively breaks an image into
rectangular blocks using horizontal and vertical projection histograms.
Rectangles are recursively split based on valleys in the histogram.  Whitespace
analysis starts with bounding boxes of black
connected components. Rectangles of whitespace are built around the black
components such that no rectangle intersects with a black component. The
resulting rectangles are repeatedly combined to form a cover. The bounding box
of the uncovered region is treated as a text segment.  Constrained Text Line
Detection first finds whitespace rectangles that represent gutters.
The gutters become obstacles in computing the bounding boxes of text lines.

Examples of bottom-up algorithms are 
    Docstrum \cite{o1993document},
    Smearing \cite{wong1982document}, 
    Voronoi \cite{kise1998segmentation}, and
    RAST \cite{breuel2001practical}.
Docstrum uses the distance between clusters of connected components. The
k-nearest-neighbors of the components are measured and the docstrum is the plot
of all nearest neighbor pairs on a page.  Smearing transforms the image at the pixel level
by setting 0 pixels to 1 based on their neighbors' values. Black areas are
connected together. The algorithm is run along rows then along columns and the
two images combined.
The Voronoi segmentation starts with centroids of connected components. A point voronoi
diagram is built around those points. Extraneous edges are filtered out leaving
an area Voronoi diagram of island regions.
RAST is a bottom-up algorithm that starts with bounding boxes of connected
components. Statistics on the boxes are used to decide if the box contains a
character. Next, the whitespace cover is computed, similar to the Constrained
Text Line algorithm \cite{breuel2002two}.  
The text lines are found based on contiguous character boxes.

Baird \cite{baird2006versatile} has a novel and interesting approach to page
segmentation. Each pixel is classified by around 100 features. Thousands of
images are used to build a training set. K-Nearest Neighbors is used
to classify each pixel in a test document. As one of the admitted assumptions
in the paper is enormous computing resources, this algorithm would be
inappropriate for the resource constraints targeted in this paper.

In this paper Voronoi and RAST are compared for their potential for use in a
memory constrained environment. A third algorithm will be included before the
final publication date.  
Voronoi was judged to be of high quality in \cite{shafait2006performance}. 
RAST is not part of the performance comparison in \cite{shafait2006performance} or \cite{mao2000empirical}. 
RAST was judged to have high quality in \cite{winder2010extending} and is one of
the core algorithms in OCRopus \cite{breuel2008ocropus}.

%  Describing the Performance Metrics
% ===================================

\section{Performance Metrics}
%``To quantitatively evaluate algorithms, a meaningful and computable metric is
%essential.'' \cite{phillips1999empirical}
The most referenced paper studying multiple page segmentation is
\cite{shafait2006performance} which used the performance metric as defined in
\cite{phillips1999empirical}. Another method used in other works is the Page
Segmentation Evaluation Toolkit (PSET) \cite{mao2000pset,mao2002software}.  For
this paper, the zone comparison program is a simplified version of the
metric chosen for the ICDAR 2007 Handwriting Segmentation Contest as described
in \cite{antonacopoulos2007page} which is also based on
\cite{phillips1999empirical}.

The text area matching algorithm of \cite{phillips1999empirical} calculates a
text area matching score by first calculating the intersection of the ground
truth bounding box and the result bounding box. The intersection is
then divided by the larger of the two areas. A set of metrics on how well the
zones were discovered are next calculated.  The one-to-many and many-to-one
matches are calculated both from the perspective of the ground truth and the
detected areas. 

For example, a single ground truth bounding box could have been split into
multiple boxes in the result. That would be a one-to-many error. Multiple
ground truth boxes combined into a single box would be a many-to-one error.
Metrics of bounding boxes of zones, measurements such as
horizontally/vertically merged lines, false detections, etc. are combined to
form a Text-line Accuracy.  

The metric chosen in this paper is based on finding only text/non-text zones.
The UW-III ZONEBOX files were particularly well adapted to this simple
metric. The \cite{winder2010extending} test image set was divided into bounding
boxes for text and non-text zones.  The metric itself was calculated using the
zone comparison program written as part of \cite{winder2010extending}. 

%The Page Segmentation Evaluation Toolkit (PSET) \cite{mao2000pset} was used to analyzed XYCUT,
%DOCSTRUM, and VORONOI algorithms as well as two commercial systems from
%Caere Corporation and ScanSoft Corporation. \cite{mao2003document} not only
%cataloged many segmentation algorithms but their performance as well.

The weights used in the zone comparison program are shown in Table
\ref{table:table-weights}. The correct one-to-one matches are weighted more
heavily than the one-to-many and the many-to-one matches, i.e., the correct
matches are weighed more heavily than the wrong matches.

\section{Strip Based Page Segmentation}

%\cite{mao2000pset} is used in this paper to compare the performance of Voronoi
%and RAST on page and strips across two data sets containing several categories
%for page images.

%Two page segmentation algorithms, Voronoi and RAST, are compared in this paper.
%The algorithms are based on the OCRopus v0.4.3  \cite{breuel2008ocropus}, 
    %but
%include the enhancements . This improved
%their performance by @@insert quantitative or qualitiative info@@.  To be able
%to compare their outputs with the ground truth, \cite{breuel2008ocropus} was
%expanded to output the zone areas in XML.

The RAST and Voronoi segmentation algorithms are used in this paper based on
the implementation of Winder in \cite{winder2010extending} and further reported
in \cite{winder2011icdar}.  The segmentation
algorithms in OCRopus v0.4.3 were extended with
additional page segmentation capabilities. The RAST algorithm was improved by
classifying and merging graphics bounding boxes and handling text boxes
overlapping graphics.  The Voronoi algorithm in OCRopus did not support zone
classification and that work was completed by Winder.

The Winder work improved average RAST performance across all image classes by
25\%. The original Voronoi implementation did not include zone classification
but the overall Voronoi performance was not as good as RAST. Where RAST would
segment at 100\%, Voronoi would get around 80\%.

%XYCut and RAST were extended to add XML zone output. The XML zone output
%allowed measurement of the improvement in page segmentation.  This study uses
%the XML output from \cite{winder2010extending} from the RAST and Voronoi page
%segmentation programs. 

The RAST and Voronoi page segmentation programs read a PNG file and output a
segmented PNG image and an XML zone file. The metric comparison is the same as
used in \cite{winder2010extending} which is the same as used in
\cite{phillips1999empirical}\cite{antonacopoulos2007page}. The metric comparison
reads a ground truth XML zone file and an output XML file. A metric with values
in the range $[0, 1.0]$ is output where 0 indicates no match and 1.0 indicates
full match.

\section{Data}

The page images used in this study come from two sources. The first is the UW-III dataset set of
1600 “LINEWORD” pages. The second is the 91 images of the Winder data set used in \cite{winder2010extending}.
The UW-III dataset is a large corpus of ground truthed scanned documents used
in many papers and competitions. 
The Winder data set is much cleaner than the UW-III dataset.
It contains simple high quality scanned pages consisting of one or two
columns of text, some pages interspersed with images. Tables 
\ref{table:UW-III Image Classes} 
and 
\ref{table:Winder Image Classes} 
describe the contents of these datasets
and the categories of page images they contain.  The tables list the image classes 
and an abbreviation (used in the figures) and a short description of the
classes is also included.

The UW-III LINEWORD dataset are scans of journals or scans of photocopies of
journals. The images are of highly varying quality. Many of the scans have page
shadow (dark area as the page fold rises above the scanner glass). 
Several of the scans have partial images of opposing pages. 
The UW-III dataset is a difficult segmentation challenge.

The Winder data set \cite{winder2010extending} consists of 
scans of pages designed with a specific function. For example, the ``Single
Column" pages are a full page of text paragraphs. Only the ``Magazine" and
``Double Column Pictures Scientific" are not pages generated specifically for
this dataset. The ``Magazine" pages are scans from actual magazines and contain
mixed layout text with halftoned graphics. The ``Double Column Pictures
Scientific" are scans of scholarly papers.  As they are all scans of individual
pieces of paper, the document image quality is quite good.

All images tested were 300 dpi.  The pages were divided into strips of 1 or 2 inches
(300 rows and 600 rows). A window slides down the page image, 10 rows at a time
(for 300) or 20 rows (for 600).  The sliding window simulates the scanned image
in memory. As new rows arrive, the oldest rows are ejected.  Each 
image was split into 330 PNG files of 300 rows each and 165 PNG files of 600
rows each.  

The UW-III images contain ZONEBOX .box files indicating rectangular ground truth text
areas of the full page images.  The UW-III .box files only labeled text areas.
The Winder images' ground truth is XML files of rectangular zones labeling both text
and non-text. 

In order to compare the segmentation results from the strip images against a
ground truth for pages, the ground truth files are divided into strips.  A full
page width strip rectangle of 300 or 600 rows was intersected with the
ground truth rectangle. The intersection of the two rectangles became a new ground truth
rectangle. The page width strip was repeatedly slid 10 or 20 rows down, then the
intersection was tested again. The final output of each ``slide" is a .XML file
indicating the ground truth in each window.

The \cite{winder2010extending} RAST and Voronoi page segmentation programs were
run against the full page to create a behavior baseline.  The RAST and Voronoi
page segmentation programs were then run against the new strip images. The output XML
was saved to a separate file. The \cite{winder2010extending} zone comparison
program based on \cite{antonacopoulos2007page} was run against the
sliced ground truth file to produce experimental results.

\section{Results}

The goal of this research is to find the algorithm that will best maintain the
performance of segmenting a full page image when the image is shrunk to a small
strip.  All images from both the UW-III and Winder datasets with 
the 300, 600 row strips, and the full page were run with both the RAST and
Voronoi algorithms. 
A comparison of the results of each segmentation algorithm versus strip size per dataset
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:all-qualitative}. 
The Winder data set is much cleaner than the UW-III dataset 
so the better results for Winder vs. UW-III are no surprise. 
The RAST algorithm appears to perform much better than Voronoi on both data sets.
RAST on a 300 row vs. a 600 row strip in the Winder dataset is little changed.
300 and 600 performed almost identically, but not as well as a full page. There
was very little additional improvement in going from a 300 row strip to a 600
row strip which would indicate the smaller strip size (and corresponding lower
memory requirements) works well.

The UW-III results are more puzzling. The degradation of results from the
strip images to the full page is understandable given the extra challenges in
the UW-III dataset images. When the image was broken up into horizontal strips,
we avoided some of the page scanning artifacts. The UW-III Voronoi results 
show an increase in performance from 300 to 600 then a sharp drop. That result
needs further exploration.

Figure~\ref{fig:winder-300-double-pic-2col300} shows the performance strip by
strip on one somewhat complicated page of two columns with included halftoned
graphics.  The overall RAST performance was 0.78 on the full page image, while
the mean of the sliding window was 0.59.  Note in many cases the performance of
an individual strip is better than the strips' mean over the whole page and
even above the performance of the entire page.  

In the figure there are several strips where a metric of zero was reported.
There are several reasons a zero/NaN metric would arise. The NaN was replaced
with zero during processing.
The source of zeros is a complete miss (no matching zones). 
A NaN results from an empty strip--there is
nothing to match and the ground truth also would be empty. 
The prevalence of white at the bottom of pages especially leads to empty zones. 
The resulting
equation would be 0/0 giving NaN. Because the original
metric was not designed to handle empty images (why would the test set contain
an empty page?), the metric would give a zero on both an empty image or empty ground
truth. 
The metric measurement program did not
expect an empty zone box. 
The bottom third of the page contained a strong graphics location then
whitespace causing the zeros which led to the drop from 0.78 to 0.59.

The results of the segmentation on every page and every slice were recorded 
and are shown as histograms in 
Figures~\ref{fig:winder_2x2} and \ref{fig:uwiii_2x2}. 
Winder has excellent performance on full page RAST and corresponding excellent
results with 300 RAST on many strips or pages.  The Voronoi results are not as
good as RAST. UW-III shows Voronoi performing better than RAST on full pages.
However, RAST 300 has much better performance than RAST full page.
Not shown in Figures~\ref{fig:winder_2x2} and \ref{fig:uwiii_2x2} are the cases
when the metric returned a zero or NaN so the zeros would not overwhelm the
histogram. 
Preliminary examination shows 27\% of the
UW-III results returned a zero and 11\% are NaN. 
Before the final publication date, work will include matching empty ground
truth with an empty segmented strip and further study of the cause of zeros.

and \ref{table:Winder Image Classes}
is shown in 
figures~\ref{fig:uwiii-class-rast-vs-vor} and \ref{fig:winder-class-rast-vs-vor}. 
The averages in these figures include the zeros and NaNs (counted numerically as zeros). In the
Winder results the full page RAST performs the best in all cases except Magazine (M). 
The Magazine images
contain text flowing around images, sometimes non-rectangular. Voronoi would be
better at handling the freer flowing format than the block-oriented RAST.
The encouraging result is that RAST 300 is in
close second to the full page on several classes. The Multi-Column layout (MC)
result is almost identical in RAST full page and RAST 300. Given the
restricted size of the segmentation area, the RAST 300 is performing very
well. The UW-III results paint a slightly
different view. On several of the classes the Voronoi performs better than the
RAST. However, the RAST 300 performs as well as or better than all other
contenders in ten of the twelve tests!

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we studied the relative performance of the RAST and Voronoi page
segmentation algorithms when the images were constrained to 300 or 600 row
strips. The tests were run against the UW-III LINEWORD images and the Winder 
image test set from \cite{winder2010extending}. The full page images were divided
into smaller images using a sliding window to partially mimic the memory
constraints of a desktop scanner.

The RAST results were almost uniformly better than Voronoi. Overall, RAST with
a 300 stripsize performed so well that the algorithm is a good candidate
for implementation in memory constrained environments. 
The RAST 600
stripsize had little improvement over the 300 stripsize even in the cases where
the full image performed much better than the strip. The one exception was the
highly mixed layout from the Magazine images in \cite{winder2010extending}.
The eventual goal would be to implement strip-wise RAST in a
hardware circuit (ASIC) for real-time performance in an MFP.  
Strip-wise RAST in many cases performed better than the full page RAST. 
Further modifications to strip-wise RAST may contribute to better full page 
segmentation when memory is not contrained.

Neither the RAST nor the Voronoi program performed any preprocessing on the incoming
image other than binarization. The input to the segmentation is the raw source
image. There is no attempt to deskew or eliminate page margin issues. The more
favorable results with the Winder dataset (compared to the UW-III dataset) is
because the Winder dataset is relatively clean. The UW-III dataset has many
artifacts that would be unlikely in a modern desktop scanner, especially the
large black areas caused by catching multiple page edges in a book scan. 

%Most
%modern desktop scanners use a CIS (Compact Image Sensor) which has a very short
%depth of field. Older scanners used a reduction optics array (several mirrors
%which shrink and redirect the image onto a single small sensor). The
%reduction optics array scanners have a very high depth of field and will thus
%capture more extraneous information.

Future work will focus on preprocessing and image clean-up suitable for a
strip. The heavy black areas (book page edges) so indicative of the UW-III
dataset would be targeted by left/right margin clean-up using connected
components. The connected components larger than a specific size and 
stretched top to bottom of the strip could be ignored.
